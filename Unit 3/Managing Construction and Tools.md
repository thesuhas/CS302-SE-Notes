# Managing Construction and Tools

Key issues critical to integrity and functionality of software solutions:

- Minimising complexity
- Anticipating change
- Constructing software for verification
- Constructing software using standards

Perspectives to look at for Managing Construction:

- **Proceeding as planned**: Involves the rate of completion and effort expenditure. Plan is adjusted based on the milestones beaten, met and missed.

    - Metrics would be number of days spent, assignment scope completed, productivity, etc.
    - `LoC/Effort Days`, `LoC Generated/Purged`

- **Technical Quality**: Lines of code, number of bugs caught. Useful when adjusting the construction plans and process.

    - LoC, Code complexity, Instruction path length.
    - `No of review errors/KLoC`

### Quality for Agile Scrum Project

- **Sprint Burndown**: Communicates the amount of work through a sprint based on story points. Goal is to consistently deliver work.
- **Team Velocity**: *amount* of software/stories that a team completes during a sprint. Can be measured in story points or hours.
- **Throughput**: Total value-added work being output by the team. Represented by units of work or **tickets** completed by a team in a set period of time.
- **Cycle Time**: Time that elapses between the start of a project till the completion.

### Construction Technical Quality

- **Peer Review**: Common name for informal process where developer shows code to other developer looking for advice and suggestions.
- **Unit Testing**: Process of writing code that will call methods in the code to be tested and checks the results.
- **Test-First**: Process of writing the test code before writing the code to be tested. 
- **Code Stepping**: Code being tested/reviewed is being executed one step at a time, debugger shows value of variables and flow of execution.

### Construction Quality

- **Pair Programming**: Two developers work on the same code. One works on function logic while the other works on syntax and accuracy.
- **Debugging**: Analyzing a code to find a known defect.
- **Code Inspection**: Formal process of peer review. Code given for review to **code inspectors**.
- **Static Analysis**: Tools that analyse code without running it.
