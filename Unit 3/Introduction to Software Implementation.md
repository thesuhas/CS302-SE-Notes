# Introduction to Software Implementation

**Software Construction/Implementation**: It is the detailed creation of working software through coding, reviews and unit testing.

Fundamental goals when constructing/implementation:

- Minimising Complexity
- Anticipating Change
- Constructing for verification
- Reuse
- Construction for others to read

Implementation has a **development environment** which can be integrated or discrete. It is a structure designed for holding code and also has a **Software Configuration Management** system designed to manage the development of the same.

### Characterising Software Construction

- Construction produces a large number of configuration items such as source files and test cases.
- It is also very tool heavy as it heavily relies on compilers, debuggers, etc.
- It is related to software quality as code is the ultimate deliverable.
- Makes extensive use of Computer Science knowledge such as Algorithms, coding practices among others.

### Choice of Programming Language depending on Level of Abstraction

- **Assembly Languages**: Map directly to the CPU Architecture.
- **Procedural Languages**: modest level of abstraction from the underlying hardware.
- **Object-Oriented Languages**: break away from CPU architecture and abstract the machine by enabling developer and designer to think about the project only in terms of **objects**.
- **Aspect-Orientation**: supported by various languages that allow the developer to separate various aspects from each other in a program. Done by adding additional behaviour to code without modifying the code itself.
