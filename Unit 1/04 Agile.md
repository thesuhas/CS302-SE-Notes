# Agile

## Limitations of Legacy Lifecycles:

- Upfront planning.
- Good when there is a definitive idea of what needs to be implemented with limited changes.
- Do not facilitate periodic customer interactions (changing customer requirements).
- Suited for large projects with complex dependencies.

## Agile

**Agile** is an **umbrella term** used to describe a variety of methods that entail:

- Continual realignment of development goals to coincide with changing customer requirements.
- Aimed at reducing massive planning overhead and to allow fast reactions to change.

Aims for **iterative development** to get a product with a subset of features into users hands as soon as possible.

Has small batch sizes to work in **sprints** that delivers software quickly.

Focuses on course correction during development to reduce cost of post-deployment support.

## Agile Manifesto:

- Individuals and interactions **over** processes and tools.
- Working Software **over** comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration **over** contract negotiation.
- Responding to change **over** following a plan.
- Focus on simplicity in **both** the product and the process.

| Pros | Cons |
| ---- | ---- |
|Realistic approach to Software Development (being flexible to change).| Cannot handle complex dependencies.|
|Resource requirements are minimum. | An overall plan, Agile leader and Agile PM are necessary for it to work. |
|Suitable for changing requirements. | Depends heavily on customer interaction. If customer is not clear, can lead to development in the wrong direction. |
|Little or no planning required. | Very high individual dependency, leading to very less documentation. |
|Good for environments that change steadily. | Transfer of tech to new team members will be touch due to lack of sufficient documentation. |

## XP

Continuous feedback and test-driven development. Delivers working software at an interval of 1-2 weeks (lesser than SCRUM).

Delivers highest priority user stories in the form of tested software on an iteration by iteration basis.

#### Common practices in XP:

- Small releases with simple design.
- Customer is **onsite** and **involved in development**.
- Coding standards.
- **Sustainable pace**, results in everyone working 40 hours a week.
- **Pair Programming**: two or more people work together. 
- **Collective code ownership**: anyone can change the code.

**Note**: XP specifies software engineering practices like those mentioned above, SCRUM is framework of management for product.

**Usage**: Requirements are unsure, system is not too big and customer is onsite.

## Lean - Agile

Seeks to **identify and eliminate activity** that is **not valued by customer or end-user**.

This results in:

- Eliminating unnecessary meetings, documentation, inefficient management such as unnecessary multi-tasking and manages flow and delivers value.
- Drives continuous inspection to adapt and improve. Called **Kaizen**.
- Focus is to provide product that addresses customers needs in the most efficient manner possible.
- Aims to reduce costs by reducing reworks and variants (as they are expensive).
