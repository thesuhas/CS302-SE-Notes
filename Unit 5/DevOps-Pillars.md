# Pillars of DevOps

Common themes that any organisation looking to implement DevOps needs to focus time and resources on are:

### Collaboration

- It is the process of working for a specific outcome through interactions and inputs of multiple groups and people.
- Teams that do not work well on the individual or intra-team level will have challenges working at the inter-team level.
- It is essential before one team can work with another team with a different focus.
- It involves:

    - Communication
    - Equal Participation
    - **Theory of Mind**: Ability to recognise ones perspective and understanding that others have different perspective based on their own context.

- Collaboration can be achieved by

    - Having a shared goal.
    - Effective Communication.
    - Different personal and professional goals.
    - Different ways of processing things, learning things or engagement in work.


### Affinity

- Measure of strength of relationships between individuals, business units teams and even companies.
