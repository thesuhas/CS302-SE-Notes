# Pillars of DevOps

Common themes that any organisation looking to implement DevOps needs to focus time and resources on are:

### Collaboration

- It is the process of working for a specific outcome through interactions and inputs of multiple groups and people.
- Teams that do not work well on the individual or intra-team level will have challenges working at the inter-team level.
- It is essential before one team can work with another team with a different focus.
- It involves:

    - Communication
    - Equal Participation
    - **Theory of Mind**: Ability to recognise ones perspective and understanding that others have different perspective based on their own context.

- Collaboration can be **achieved** by

    - Having a shared goal.
    - Effective Communication.
    - Different personal and professional goals.
    - Different ways of processing things, learning things or engagement in work.


### Affinity

- Measure of strength of relationships between individuals, business units, teams and even companies.
- **Building Affinity** is the process of building these inter-team relationships, navigating different goals or metrics while keeping in mind shared organisational goals and fostering empathy between different groups of people.

Can be **measured** via:

- Shared time
- Reciprocity of shared stories
- Reciprocity of support
- Intensity of relationships

Can be achieved via:

- Shared values
- Consistent team culture
- Team cohesion

### Tools

- Ease of use of tools impacts the acceleration of DevOps.
- Tools which are beneficial for only a subset of teams/people or lack of teams will get in the way of effective collaboration between teams.
- Helps reduce the cost of collaboration.

### Scaling

- Takes into account how other pillars of DevOps can be applied to an organisation as it grows and adapts.
- There are both technical and cultural considerations.
- Can be organisation, workload, infrastructure, teams, etc.
