## Traditional Team

- Workers are collocated or **in-house**. They are teams that share the same physical workspace.
- Social group of individuals with interdependent tasks.
- Achieve common goals.

## Global Software Development (GSD) Team

- Group of workers located in various locations across the world building commercially viable software for a company.
- Same goals as traditional teams.
- Differentiated by Global Distance.
- Linked by communication tech.

## Different Types of Development

- **Collocated Development**: Housed within the same floor/building.
- **Multi-site Development**: Members are distributed across different sites.
- **Global Development**: If distribution of members exceeds the boundaries of a given country.

### Advantages of Global Development

- Larger pool of developers.
- Can use time difference to increase productivity hours.
- Locate developers closer to markets and clients.
- Taking advantage of diverse stakeholder's knowledge and experiences.

- **Coordination**: Task awareness and sense of urgency.
- **Control**: Accurate status information and uniform process across teams.
- **Cultural**: Social background, attitude to authority, etc.
