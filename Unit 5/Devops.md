# DevOps

- It is the combination of cultural philosophies, tools and practices that help increase an organisation's ability to deliver (develop and support) applications and services at a high velocity.
- It is a blend of **Development** and **Operations**. Refers to a collaborative approach to the tasks performed by the Development teams and IT Services teams which help set-up and manage infrastructure for both internal and external clients.
- Intends to make the enterprise processes faster, more efficient, and more reliable to increase Business value.
- Removes repetitive manual behaviour.
- Extension of Agile and also follows an Agile Manifesto Principle, *Individuals and Interactions are more important than Processes or Tools*.
