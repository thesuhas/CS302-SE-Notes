# Test Cases

- Test cases are a key part of the test documentation.
- Tells the tester what to test, how to check and what the expected results are.
- Also helps determine whether the software satisfies the requirement/function.
- Acts as the starting point for test execution, after applying a set of input values, application has a definitive outcome and leaves the system at an end point known as **execution postcondition**.
- Well-written test cases enable anyone to jump into the tester role and determine whether or not the piece of software is functioning satisfactory.
- Also ensure proper test coverage of application under test.
- Makes tester to thoroughly think through different ways of validating features.
- Test cases are also reusable.

Types of Test Cases:

- **Positive**: Verifies that the software is doing what it is supposed to do.
- **Negative**: Verifies that the software is not doing what it is not supposed to.
- **Destructive**: Examins scenarios that the software can handle before it breaks.

Best Practices:

- Keep title short
- Include a **strong** description
- Clear and concise
- Include the expected result
- Ensure test case is reusable.

## Test Suites

- It is a container that has a set of tests which help testers in executing and reporting results.
- Can take three states: Active, In-progress, and completed.
- Test case can be added to multiple test suites and test plans.
- Can have functional and non-functional test cases.
